## 📘 Lesson 10 – Functions, Parameters & Flexibility

### 🔧 What I did
- Defined and called custom functions using `def`
- Used parameters and arguments to pass data into functions
- Added default parameter values to allow flexible function calls
- Validated input types using `type()` and conditionals
- Introduced `*args` to accept any number of positional arguments (as a tuple)
- Used `**kwargs` to accept any number of named arguments (as a dictionary)

### ⚠️ What went wrong
- N/A

### 🧠 What I learned
- Functions make code reusable and organized
- Parameters can have default values to avoid errors or unnecessary arguments
- `return` gives back values from functions, while `print()` just shows them on screen
- `*args` is used when you don’t know how many values will be passed
- `**kwargs` is used for dynamic keyword-based arguments, creating a dictionary of inputs

### 💭 Reflection

It was fun defining and calling my own functions. Understanding the difference between arguments and parameters, and the differnet ways of inputting data types into them.
