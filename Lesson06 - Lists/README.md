## 📘 Lesson 6 – Lists and Tuples

### 🔧 What I did
- Created and modified lists and tuples
- Used indexing, slicing, and method functions (`.append()`, `.sort()`, etc.)
- Explored list copying techniques and tuple unpacking

### ⚠️ What went wrong
- N/A

### 🧠 What I learned
- Lists are **mutable**; tuples are **immutable**
- Lists can be modified using methods or slicing
- Tuples can be converted to lists for editing
- Use `.copy()`, `list()`, or slicing (`[:]`) to safely copy lists
- `sorted()` creates a new list; `.sort()` modifies in-place
- Tuple unpacking allows for structured variable assignment

### 💭 Reflection
This was another smooth section. Lists especially feel powerful and flexible and I can already imagine using them in automation/data journey. Tuple unpacking was new to me but seems useful.

A lot of learning to breakdown here, I am confident in my ability create results, but not confident in knowing the python/computer science lingo at textbook knowledge. 

However, my goal is clear. I need to produce results. This means projects. The necessary lingo/knowledge will present itself at the right time - if needed at all.
