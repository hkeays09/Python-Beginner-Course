## Lesson 1 - Getting Started



### What I did
- Installed Python and VS Code
- Wrote my first program: `Hello World!`

### What went wrong
- Forgot to add Python to PATH
- VS Code couldn't detect the interpreter
- Searching for Python launched the app store (frustrating)

### What I learned:
- How to correctly install Python and link it to VS Code
- Importance of environment setup

### Reflection:

It was annoying at first, but I’m glad I pushed through. Here’s to more!
