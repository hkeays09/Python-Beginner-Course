## 📘 Lesson 16 – Challenges

### 🔧 What I did
- Built two Command Line Interface (CLI) games:
  - **Rock, Paper, Scissors** with personalised names and persistent game stats
  - **Guess My Number** with percentage win tracking and fun ASCII reactions
- Created an **Arcade menu** to choose between games or quit
- Used `argparse` for command-line name input
- Applied concepts from earlier lessons:
  - Nested functions and `nonlocal` variables
  - Enumerations (`Enum`)
  - Random number generation
  - f-strings for cleaner output
- Organised code into separate modules for reusability

### ⚠️ What went wrong
- Had some issues with calling the functions in the Arcade, and using return to get everything to go back to the arcade.

### 🧠 What I learned
- Combining multiple lessons into one project is the best way to reinforce knowledge
- Separating code into modules keeps it maintainable and easy to expand
- `argparse` is a professional way to handle user input in CLI programs
- Personalisation and small UI touches (like ASCII faces) improve engagement

### 💭 Reflection
This was the first big challenge that brought together everything I’ve learned so far. It felt closer to real-world coding — planning, connecting scripts, and tracking state — rather than just following along with exercises. 

It was great to use AI here to guide me, while also double checking its suggestions. I caught it out a few times, and had to course correct loads. But wow this tool helped so much, I was able to get this working exactly as intended.

A much more satisfying experience than using MATLAB without AI in 2020/2021.

Finally, I am pretty happy with my knowledge level at this stage. However, the argparse stuff doesn't make too much sense to me, at least I know how to use it.
