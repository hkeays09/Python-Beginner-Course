## Lesson 4 - Data Types

### What I did
- Went through a range of **commands, data types, operators, functions** and how they interact with eachother to create outputs.

### What went wrong
- N/A

### What I learned
- A lot about how strings, integers, boolean data types can be manipulated to reach various desired outcomes (i.e casting an integer to a string)

### Reflection
Another smooth section of the course. A much more enjoyable experience when things go as expected. 

Error challenges of this nature I look forward to solving in the future, but for now errors should be minimised to maximise tutorial completion speed (despite potential learning gains when met).
