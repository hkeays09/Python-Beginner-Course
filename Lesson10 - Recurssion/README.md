## 📘 Lesson 10 – Functions, Parameters & Flexibility

### 🔧 What I did
- Practiced recursion — calling a function from within itself

### ⚠️ What went wrong
- Very minor syntax and formatting errors which were quickly solved with AI and Anaconda formatter.

### 🧠 What I learned
- Functions make code reusable and organized
- Parameters can have default values to avoid errors or unnecessary arguments
- `return` gives back values from functions, while `print()` just shows them on screen
- **Recursion** is when a function calls itself — useful for tasks that can be broken into smaller, similar sub-tasks
- Recursive functions must have a **base case** to stop, otherwise they loop forever and cause an error

### 💭 Reflection
A great lesson, with AI and Anaconda formatter being useful for any formatting/syntax errors. Recursion also makes code a lot more neat.
