## 📘 Lesson 13 – String Formatting & f-Strings

### 🔧 What I did
- Practiced multiple ways to format strings in Python:
  - `%s` placeholders
  - `.format()` method (with positional, keyword, and dictionary unpacking)
  - **f-strings** (formatted string literals)
- Used expressions and method calls inside f-strings (e.g., `.lower()`, arithmetic)
- Added number formatting options to f-strings (`.2f` for decimal places, `.2%` for percentages)
- Updated the Rock, Paper, Scissors game to use f-strings for cleaner, more readable output

### ⚠️ What went wrong
- N/A

### 🧠 What I learned
- f-strings are the most modern and preferred way to format strings in Python
- They allow variables, expressions, and method calls to be embedded directly in strings
- Formatting options like `.2f` and `.2%` make it easy to control number display
- Updating existing code (like the RPS game) with f-strings can make it both shorter and more readable

### 💭 Reflection
A much easier way, but also a small learning curve to using the f-string method to format my strings.
