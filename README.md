## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are the main projects I built during the course:

- 🕹️ [**Arcade Challenge**](Lesson16-Challenge)  
  Combines multiple games (`Rock, Paper, Scissors + Guess My Number`) into one terminal-based arcade.  

- 🏦 [**Bank Account OOP Project**](Lesson20-OOPProject/)  
  Simple bank account system using classes and object-oriented programming.

- 🌦️ [**Weather Web App**](https://github.com/hkeays09/python-weather)  
  A Flask-based web application that fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in the browser.  
  - Secure API key management with `.env`  
  - Error handling for invalid/empty city names  
  - Templating with HTML + CSS  
  - Deployed locally using Waitress

## 🧠 Core Skills Gained (So Far)

- ✅ Writing and running `.py` scripts  
- ✅ Variables, data types, and print formatting  
- ✅ Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- ✅ Loops (`for`, `while`) and control flow (`break`, `continue`)  
- ✅ Data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries  
- ✅ Functions, arguments, return values  
- ✅ Using built-in modules (`random`, `sys`, `enum`, `os`)  
- ✅ Command line arguments with `argparse`  
- ✅ Creating and importing custom modules  
- ✅ Structuring programs with `if __name__ == "__main__":` for reusability  
- ✅ File handling (read, write, append, error handling)  
- ✅ Virtual environments (`venv`) and dependency management  
- ✅ Git & GitHub for tracking projects and progress  
- ✅ Intro to Flask: routes, templates, static files, API integration

## 📈 Reflection

This course has given me:
- A strong foundation in Python syntax and core concepts  
- Hands-on experience with small but complete projects  
- An understanding of how to structure, debug, and grow Python programs  
- My **first full-stack style project** (Lesson 23 Weather App) — combining Python backend, API calls, and a web frontend  

It shows not just the code, but the **progression from basics → real applications**.
