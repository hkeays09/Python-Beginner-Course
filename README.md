## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are a few standout projects from the course so far:

- 🎮 **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  
  Simple CLI game using `if`, `elif`, `else`, user input, and the `random` module.

- 🔢 **Meaning Number Script**  
  Small script that prints messages based on a numeric variable — a great intro to conditionals.

- 🖨️ **Hello World**  
  First Python script to test environment setup and print output.

👉 *More projects will appear as I progress through the course.*

## 🤖 Built with Practice + AI Support

All code is written while learning from scratch, with AI tools (like ChatGPT) used to clarify concepts, debug issues, and explain best practices.  
The goal is not to shortcut learning — but to accelerate it.

> I believe AI is a valid, powerful tool for learning, problem-solving, and building real-world software.
