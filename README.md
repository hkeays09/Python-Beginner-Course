## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are the main projects I built during the course:

- 🖨️ **Hello World**  
  First Python script to test environment setup and print output.

- 🔢 **Guess My Number Challenge**  
  Fun number-guessing game with win percentage tracking.  

- 🎮 **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (Enhanced)**  
  Terminal-based game featuring multiple rounds, score tracking, and personalised player names via command line arguments.  

- 🕹️ **Arcade Challenge**  
  Combines multiple games (Rock, Paper, Scissors + Guess My Number) into one terminal-based arcade.  

- 🐦 **Random Fun Fact Module**  
  A custom module that stores fun facts and demonstrates importing without auto-running unless executed directly.  

- 📂 **File Operations Practice**  
  Read, write, append, and create files with Python’s `open()` and context managers, plus error handling with `try/except/finally`.  

- 🌦️ **Lesson 23 – Final Project: Weather Web App**  
  A Flask-based web application that fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in the browser.  
  - Secure API key management with `.env`  
  - Error handling for invalid/empty city names  
  - Templating with HTML + CSS  
  - Deployed locally using Waitress

## 🧠 Core Skills Gained (So Far)

- ✅ Writing and running `.py` scripts  
- ✅ Variables, data types, and print formatting  
- ✅ Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- ✅ Loops (`for`, `while`) and control flow (`break`, `continue`)  
- ✅ Data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries  
- ✅ Functions, arguments, return values  
- ✅ Using built-in modules (`random`, `sys`, `enum`, `os`)  
- ✅ Command line arguments with `argparse`  
- ✅ Creating and importing custom modules  
- ✅ Structuring programs with `if __name__ == "__main__":` for reusability  
- ✅ File handling (read, write, append, error handling)  
- ✅ Virtual environments (`venv`) and dependency management  
- ✅ Git & GitHub for tracking projects and progress  
- ✅ Intro to Flask: routes, templates, static files, API integration

## 📈 Reflection

This course has given me:
- A strong foundation in Python syntax and core concepts  
- Hands-on experience with small but complete projects  
- An understanding of how to structure, debug, and grow Python programs  
- My **first full-stack style project** (Lesson 23 Weather App) — combining Python backend, API calls, and a web frontend  

It shows not just the code, but the **progression from basics → real applications**.
