## 📘 Lesson 9 – Loops & Enums

### 🔧 What I did
- Upadated the RPS project to include `while`' loops and other functions such as `break`

### ⚠️ What went wrong
- Had a few syntax and formatting errors initially when editing the RPS program. Very quickly solved with the use of copilot, would have taken ages to figure out each one. I do understand generally where I went wrong (main issue being incorrect tabbing with the while loop). 

### 🧠 What I learned
- `while` loops are useful for repeating a process like a game loop
- `break` stops a loop immediately; `continue` skips to the next iteration
- The `else` clause in loops runs only if the loop completes normally (not interrupted by `break`)
- `for x in range(start, stop, step)` is great for controlled repetition
- Nested loops allow combining elements across two lists

### 💭 Reflection
Another smooth section where AI helped maintain a steady learning pace while still maximising understanding. The exercises felt realistic and reflected the kind of scenarios I might encounter in a real-world project.
