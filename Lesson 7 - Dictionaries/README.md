## 📘 Lesson 7 – Dictionaries and Sets

### 🔧 What I did
- Created dictionaries using literals and `dict()`
- Accessed, updated, and deleted key-value pairs
- Copied dictionaries properly with `.copy()` and `dict()`
- Created and modified sets using various methods
- Performed set operations like `union`, `intersection_update`, and `symmetric_difference_update`

### ⚠️ What went wrong
- N/A

### 🧠 What I learned
- Dictionaries store key-value pairs and are fully mutable
- Direct assignment shares references — use `.copy()` to avoid side effects
- Sets are unordered, don’t allow duplicates, and can’t be indexed
- Sets are useful for comparing or combining collections of values
