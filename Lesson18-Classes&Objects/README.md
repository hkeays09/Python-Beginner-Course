## 📘 Lesson 18 – Classes, Inheritance & Polymorphism  

### 🔧 What I did  
- Created a `Vehicle` class with attributes (`make`, `model`) and methods (`moves`, `get_make_model`)  
- Instantiated objects like `my_car` and `your_car` from the class  
- Built subclasses (`Airplane`, `Truck`, `GolfCart`) that:  
  - Inherit from `Vehicle`  
  - Add new parameters (e.g., `faa_id` in `Airplane`)  
  - **Override methods** (e.g., custom `moves()` implementations)  
- Used a loop to demonstrate **polymorphism**: the same method (`moves`) behaves differently depending on the object type.  

### ⚠️ What went wrong  
- N/A

### 🧠 What I learned  
- **Classes** let you bundle attributes (data) and methods (behavior) together.  
- **Inheritance** allows new classes to reuse and extend existing functionality.  
- **Polymorphism** means the same method call can produce different outcomes depending on the object’s class.  

### 💭 Reflection  
- OOP makes code more modular and reusable.  
- Understanding inheritance and polymorphism is key for designing scalable software and larger projects.
