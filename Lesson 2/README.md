## 📘 Lesson 2 – Python Basics

### 🔧 What I did
- Learned basic Python commands
- Explored how files, folders, and terminals interact with VS Code
- Tried setting up formatting tools

### ⚠️ What went wrong
- Formatter wouldn’t work using shortcut methods
- Python extension no longer includes a built-in formatter
- Terminal installs didn’t fix it — likely PATH issues
- Installing **Anaconda as a VS Code extension** solved the problem

### 🧠 What I learned
- VS Code's Python setup has changed
- Formatters require extra setup now (PATH or extensions)
- Anaconda extension is a useful workaround

### 💭 Reflection

Another set up challenge here. Hopefully a smoother run through as I progress through the tutorial.
