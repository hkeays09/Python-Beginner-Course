## Lesson 2 - Python Basics

### What I did
- Learned basic Python commands
- Explored how terminals, files, and folders interact with VS Code
- Tried setting up Python formatting tools in VS Code

### What went wrong
- Formatter wouldn’t work despite following shortcut methods and recommended setups
- Discovered that the Python extension no longer includes a built-in formatter
- Attempted to install other formatters via the terminal — didn’t fix the issue
- Likely cause: no PATH set up to the new formatters

### What I learned
- VS Code setup for Python has changed (no built-in formatter anymore)
- Installing formatters via the terminal might not work without PATH configuration
- Installing **Anaconda as a VS Code extension** solved the formatter issue

### Reflection
Another setup challenge, but I’m pushing through. Having a background in MATLAB, access to ChatGPT, and a tech-savvy brother definitely helps. I’ve already learned a lot - feeling optimistic as I move forward.
