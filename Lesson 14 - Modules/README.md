## 📘 Lesson 14 – Modules

### 🔧 What I did
- Learned how to create and import my own Python modules
- Created a simple module with variables and a `randomfunfact()` function
- Used `from ... import ...` to import specific elements from a module
- Used `if __name__ == "__main__":` to control when code runs
- Updated the Rock, Paper, Scissors game to follow the same structure so it can be imported without auto-running

### ⚠️ What went wrong
- N/A

### 🧠 What I learned
- A **module** is just a Python file you can import into other scripts
- `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures code only runs when the file is executed directly, not when imported
- You can import specific functions or variables instead of the entire module
- Structuring code with `__main__` makes it reusable and cleaner

### 💭 Reflection
A principle which was touched on earlier in the course. It was nice to go more in depth with the potential use cases for it.
